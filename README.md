## Introduction

This is the directory where I am saving Jupyter Notebooks and related files for the edX course [Machine Learning with Python: A Practical Introduction(https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:IBM+ML0101EN+3T2019/course/).
I follow the code along the lectures, and make revisions and expansions when I get to each module lab.


## Installation
